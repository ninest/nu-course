The number of individuals affected by mental health concerns is substantially higher than many people realize. Roughly half of us will meet criteria for a mental health disorder at some point during our lifetimes and nearly all of us will go through periods of time in which our mental health suffers. The scope of mental health challenges we face as a society requires innovative and comprehensive approaches that touch on every aspect of the spaces we live in, the technologies we interact with, and the information we engage with every day. Through these mediums, design has the power to both exacerbate and alleviate mental health challenges, underscoring the need for designers to develop mental health literacy. Through a combination of critical readings, case studies, and an independent project, students in this course will gain an in-depth understanding of the nature of mental disorders and will learn concrete principles and tools for using design to promote better mental health.

The latter consists of two parts: a task organization (ranging from the description of data to the creation of a test suite) and a data-oriented approach to the organization of programs (ranging from atomic data to self-referential data definitions and functions as data). The course then progresses to object-oriented design, explaining how it generalizes and contrasts with functional design. In addition to studying program design, students also have an opportunity to practice pair-programming and public code review techniques, as found in industry today."

Draws from economic principles, developing concepts such as efficiency, property rights, regulation, and income distribution. Uses mathematical notation to model the incentives created by various legal rules. Solutions to cost minimization and utility maximization problems reveal whether particular laws induce economic agents to act in a manner consistent with the social optimum. Applications of these ideas may include health and safety, the environment, the legal services and insurance industries, and zoning and land use, among others."

The appropriation of the medieval is ubiquitous, and never ideologically innocent, running the gamut from Wagner&rsquo;s Ring opera to the Med-Ren Faire to Dreamworks&rsquo; Shrek to the shields that white supremacists carried in Charlottesville. In this course, our focus is on the persistence of the Middle Ages as a mode and a theme in literature, music, art, and architecture, as well as in film, video games, and other artifacts of popular culture. We will consider such topics as aesthetics, pleasure, danger, canonization, genre, colonialism, the gothic, fantasy literature, and modern responses to medieval representations of class, race, gender, and sexual preference and identity, and pair &ldquo;host&rdquo; texts and &ldquo;symbiont&rdquo; texts, such as Malory&rsquo;s Morte Darthur and a selection of Chaucer&rsquo;s Canterbury Tales and their reworkings, including film. As we read such texts as the Irish T&aacute;in B&oacute; C&uacute;ailnge, the French Tristan and Iseult and Roman de Silence (a tale of born-sex vs. cultural assignment), the Icelandic V&iacute;nland Sagas (the tale of the Norse discovery of America), and the West African Sundiata, we will explore how&mdash;and why&mdash;we read medieval texts now.

    "description": "Justice-Oriented Writing Assessment: Antiracist, Decolonial, and Anti-Ableist Approaches to Evaluating Writing: In the U.S., writing assessment is woven through our lives. In pre-schools, children&rsquo;s&rsquo; development is, in part, traced through their recognition of letters and their pre-literacy abilities. In the K-12 educational system, high-stakes writing assessments are mandated by federal and state governments and are one metric to track school if schools are meeting grade-level learning standards. In colleges, writing assessment is used to track students and measure the &ldquo;effectiveness&rdquo; of programs. Teachers and writing center tutors also use writing assessment methods, such as response and self-assessment, to help writers meet their goals. Within workplaces and professional programs, writing assessment is a means to determine qualifications of candidates and determine licensure. Finally, writing assessment has played a role in U.S. immigration policies and colonialism. In short, the assessment of writing is ubiquitous in U.S. culture. While there has long been attention to the injustices of testing, today there is a renewed urgency to challenging and changing unjust writing assessment practices. In this course, we will learn key theoretical ideas about evaluation and learning, explore the histories of use and misuse of writing testing in the U.S., and wrestle with emerging antiracist, decolonial, and anti-ableist approaches to writing assessment. Such justice-oriented frameworks and methods can be applied to the teaching and assessment of writing in any context. Students will be given options for different kinds of projects to fulfill the course requirements. All evaluation in this course will be shared evaluation methods."

We will begin by detecting the ways in which we are constructed as discursive subjects in the colonial matrix of power. What are our privileges as these relate to modern imperial legacies of knowing and being? What are our baselines for normalcy and difference as these relate to modern imperial legacies of knowing and being?\n \nThe second part of the course asks us to name and epistemically delink from rhetorics of difference. We will learn to unlearn the ways in which we are written by imperial pasts and presents. In what ways might the consumption and production of rhetorics of difference contribute to sustaining imperial legacies of power? In what ways might we as discursive subjects embody and practice social, linguistic, racial, and epistemic differencing? What is to be done?\n \nThe third part of the course introduces decolonial methodology and methods to oppose and unsettle the creation of difference. We will imagine and propose decolonial projects of doing, making, and being as we take up the questions: How can we unsettle the production of difference in our teaching, research, and day-to-day practice of knowing and being? How might we as students, scholars, teachers, and citizens of earth engage in decoloniality and create together pluriversal possibilities?\n \nFinally, we will present the initial results of our praxis projects as we attempt to create alternatives to rhetorics of difference. What projects might we propose to recuperate suppressed epistemologies or to imagine alternatives to the hierarchical structures of everyday life or to help our students learn to unlearn? Assignments will include original scholarship and analyses, presentations, a project proposal and initial results."

Studies the historical underpinnings of journalism&rsquo;s gender gap and practical strategies to navigate identity politics in a modern newsroom. For decades, women have represented the majority of journalism and mass communication students, but they remain the minority at most U.S. news organizations. This gender gap is, of course, not unique to journalism, but the paucity of women in newsrooms negatively impacts society. When news narratives are constructed primarily by men, those narratives often perpetuate &ldquo;symbolic annihilation&rdquo;&mdash;a term commonly used by feminist and queer scholars to describe the ways the media overlooks or stereotypes women and other marginalized identities."

During the first part of the course, we closely examine influential frameworks for understanding and designing intelligent systems, develop a concrete sense of how these frameworks work, and critically assess their successes and shortcomings from philosophical, empirical, and design perspectives. In the second part of the course, we build on this background to explore some of the implications of emerging technologies, such as deep learning and large language models, augmented and virtual reality, brain-machine interface, memory transfer, and more."

Requires prior completion of three philosophy courses or instructor&#39;s permission.\n\nCourse description: &quot;The Earth is spherical&quot; and &quot;it is wrong to kill innocent children for fun&quot; are both true sentences. Neither of these, the empirical claim nor the ethical claim are particularly controversial. However, while there is very little (reasonable) controversy about what makes the first sentence true (and how we know it is true), there is considerable controversy about both the metaphysics and epistemology of the second claim and others like it.\n\nThis seminar will provide a broad and deep overview of central answers to metaethical questions about what makes moral claims true and how we know them. The seminar will start with a quick refresher of answers to metaethical questions that are, for the most part and for good reason, not taken seriously by contemporary metaethicists, like Cultural Relativism and Divine Command Theory.&nbsp; We will then turn to what are widely-considered the live options in contemporary Western metaethics. Some of these views deny that moral claims are true or false (Non-Cognitivism), some claim that all moral claims are false (Error Theory) or that moral language is simply a fiction where we pretend some moral claims are true (Fictionalism). On most views, there are genuine truth-makers for moral claims, but there is much disagreement about what they are. On some views, they are grounded in our subjective attitudes or desires (Subjectivism), on others they are tightly bound up with rationality (constructivism), on yet others, the moral truth-makers are entirely independent of us, either very much like the natural facts that make empirical claims true (Naturalist Realism) or some more mysterious kind of non-natural fact (Non-naturalist Realism). After a critical survey of the terrain, we&#39;ll turn our attention to book-length treatments of particular views or articles that push us to think about metaethical issues in new ways.&nbsp;"

But what about Cardi B posing as the Hindu Goddess Durga in a Reebok ad, AA&rsquo;s twelve-step invocation of God, or the earnest namaste you utter at the end of yoga class?\n\nIn this class we will unpack the ethical dilemmas of a messy form of cultural appropriation: the borrowing of religious doctrines, rituals, and dress for political, educational, and therapeutic reasons. Does borrowing from another&rsquo;s religion harm believers? Who can consent to such borrowings? Religion is an especially vexing arena for appropriation debates because diversity within religious groups scrambles our sense of who is an insider and who is not. In order to understand why some appropriations are insulting and others benign, we will have to ask difficult philosophical questions about what religions really are.\n\nStudents will develop their own independent research projects and create public-facing ways to share their findings."

Many of the largest and most rapidly growing cities in these regions are in low-lying coastal cities in river deltas and, consequently, face significant dangers of flooding and eventual inundation. Climate change also has implications for access to freshwater and for the incidence of heat waves. The impacts of climate-change-related hazards tend to fall most heavily on the poorest, raising new issues of social inequality. This course examines concepts of urban vulnerability and resilience and climate change adaptation, as well as case studies of policy approaches for addressing the impacts of climate change on cities."

Uses particular paradigmatic &amp;#8220;case studies&amp;#8221; to push hard at the boundaries of sex and gender and to dialogue around contesting conceptualizations of &amp;#8220;the body,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;sex,&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;gender,&amp;#8221; particularly as they circulate in specific discourses of feminism, queer theory, and poststructuralism; ethnic studies; critical race theory; and cultural studies."
