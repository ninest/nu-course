Introduces analytical skills of observation and methods of contextual analysis (materialism, semiotics, feminisms, LGBTQ studies, queer theory, theories of decolonization and disability studies), in order for students to develop compelling interpretations of visual phenomena within a shifting global context. Visual Intelligence explains how visual studies connects to the fields of law, design, publishing, curating, conservation, and other areas of knowledge production."},{"subject":"ARTH","number":"1002","title":"Seminar in Visual Intelligence","scheduleType":"Seminar","credits":2,"nuPath":[],"_termReferenceMap":{"202310":"20515"},"description":"Accompanies ARTH 1001.
