Builds a theoretical foundation for students to properly choose computational methods to solve common research problems in chemistry, biochemistry, and materials science. Also introduces the field of research in computational chemistry. Suitable for advanced undergraduate students and graduate students who plan to conduct research in the field of computational chemistry or plan to utilize computational techniques to complement experimental research in the molecular sciences."},{"subject":"CHEM","number":"5670","title":"Global Biogeochemistry","scheduleType":"Lecture","credits":4,"nuPath":["ND"],"_termReferenceMap":{"202310":"19221"},"description":"Examines the biological, chemical, and physical interactions that shape our global environment. These interactions combine in the global biogeochemical cycles. Industrial emission of gases, use of fertilizers and plastics, and the expansion of cities are altering the biogeochemical cycling of the elements carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus at rates unprecedented in the geological record. Uses lectures and the latest update to Chapter 6, &ldquo;Carbon and Other Biogeochemical Cycles,&rdquo; of the International Panel on Climate Change report to explore the main interactions between human activity, biogeochemical change, and climate.
