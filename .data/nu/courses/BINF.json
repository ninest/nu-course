Offers students an opportunity to work with current methods and computational algorithms used in contemporary sequence analysis. Teaches practical skills necessary to manage and mine the vast biological information being generated and housed in public databases. Emphasizes the use of Python as the primary computer language and requires students to learn and understand basic computer logic and syntax, including an introduction to scalars, arrays, hashes, decision statements, loops, subroutines, references, and regular expressions. A focus on fundamental skills, including the command line interface found in the Linux operating system, is designed to prepare students for second-semester applications."},{"referenceNumber":"12582","subject":"BINF","number":"6309","title":"Bioinformatics Computational Methods 2","scheduleType":"Lecture","credits":4,"nuPath":[],"_termCode":"202310","description":"Designed to build upon the core topics covered in BINF 6308, i.e., use of the computer as a tool for bioinformatics research. Builds upon the Python language fundamentals covered during the first semester but requires students to apply these fundamentals to a semester-long project. The project includes protein family analysis, multiple sequence analysis, phylogeny, and protein structure analysis. Additionally, students have an opportunity to learn to build, load, connect, and query custom MySQL databases, and parse command line flags."},{"referenceNumber":"14650","subject":"BINF","number":"6400","title":"Genomics in Bioinformatics","scheduleType":"Lecture","credits":4,"nuPath":[],"_termCode":"202310","description":"Introduces the field of genomics.
