Projects focus on the creation and cultivation of public space, transformation of site conditions, and development of sustainable site materials. Emphasizes site analysis, development of an individual design process, and design communication strategies. This studio course introduces students to urban design precedents, site research, and remediation methods through case studies, lectures, site visits, and workshops."},{"referenceNumber":"11523","subject":"LARC","number":"2230","title":"Introduction to Sustainable Site Planning and Design","scheduleType":"Lecture","credits":4,"nuPath":["ND"],"_termCode":"202310","description":"Addresses fundamental techniques of sustainable site design in the built environment, including earthworks, water, and soils, using current-day storm events. Primary topics include topography, site grading, study models, universal accessibility, and storm water considerations in urban and other built environments. Introduces students to urban tree planting techniques, graphic communications, basic site materials, and construction details."},{"referenceNumber":"19713","subject":"LARC","number":"2330","title":"Cities, Landscape, and Modern Culture","scheduleType":"Lecture","credits":4,"nuPath":["ER","SI","WI"],"_termCode":"202310","description":"Seeks to instill basic landscape literacy enabling students to read urban landscapes and recognize different ways of knowing landscapes, including everyday landscapes. Presents key concepts, ethical debates, and iconic works that gave shape to modernism in landscape architecture and urbanism. Focusing on eighteenth-century through mid-twentieth-century projects and designers, examines contextual factors and resulting formal, spatial, organizational, and material characteristics of built works. Using case studies, challenges students to analyze the entangled histories of landscape preservation and urban segregation and to apply theories of environmental ethics and environmental justice to questions about the built environment and the relationship between natural and social systems. Offers students an opportunity to practice formulation of a critical design perspective and landscape interpretation via reading responses, project analysis, written work, podcasts, and StoryMaps."},{"referenceNumber":"20522","subject":"LARC","number":"2430","title":"Plants, People, and Landscape Change","scheduleType":"Lecture","credits":4,"nuPath":["ND"],"_termCode":"202310","description":"Uses the study of New England&rsquo;s plant communities and plant identification as a framework to consider the evolution of the New England landscape from European colonization to the present.

Human activity, land use, and settlement patterns all influence the development of landscape, and our cultural history is expressed in the species demographics, land forms, and ecosystem dynamics of our environment."},{"referenceNumber":"12530","subject":"LARC","number":"3170","title":"Landscape Planning and Urbanism Studio","scheduleType":"Studio","credits":6,"nuPath":[],"_termCode":"202310","description":"Introduces sustainable landscape planning techniques with an emphasis on adaptive urbanism. Key topics include the designed and managed relationship of cities to their regional ecologies, such as sub/urbanized watersheds and coastal zones, as well as the spatial, material, and programmatic roles of environmental infrastructures in the civic landscape. Particularly emphasizes the market-based integration of recreation, transit, food, housing, and industrial networks with living systems such as urban forests, riparian corridors, managed habitats, and constructed wetlands."},{"referenceNumber":"13442","subject":"LARC","number":"5110","title":"Advanced Design for Urban Environments Studio","scheduleType":"Studio","credits":6,"nuPath":[],"_termCode":"202310","description":"Focuses on ecological, economic, and social resiliency of designed urban environments in response to globalization. Contemporary case studies of urban change provide the basis for design investigation into issues such as the impact of shifting industries on Detroit (deurbanization) or Shenzhen (rapid densification); shifting weather and water patterns in densely populated regions; societal shifts, from generational demographics to political upheavals and militarization/demilitarization of the urban landscape.
