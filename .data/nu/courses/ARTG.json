The number of individuals affected by mental health concerns is substantially higher than many people realize. Roughly half of us will meet criteria for a mental health disorder at some point during our lifetimes and nearly all of us will go through periods of time in which our mental health suffers. The scope of mental health challenges we face as a society requires innovative and comprehensive approaches that touch on every aspect of the spaces we live in, the technologies we interact with, and the information we engage with every day. Through these mediums, design has the power to both exacerbate and alleviate mental health challenges, underscoring the need for designers to develop mental health literacy. Through a combination of critical readings, case studies, and an independent project, students in this course will gain an in-depth understanding of the nature of mental disorders and will learn concrete principles and tools for using design to promote better mental health.
