Interpreting for theatrical or otherwise scripted communication is markedly different from other forms of interpreting. The availability of a script, ample time to rehearse, and the possibility of feedback makes this a hybrid practice—part interpreting, part translation, and part performance. Offers students an opportunity to learn how to analyze scripts for both content and interpreting issues; how to solve production problems of logistics, placement, and lighting; and how to interpret a series of performances for the Deaf Community. This course is offered in conjunction with or in advance of a theatre department production or other performed text.",
