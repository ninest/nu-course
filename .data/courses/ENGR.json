    "description": "Examines, in this interdisciplinary course, modern energy usage, consequences, and options to support sustainable energy development from a variety of fundamental and applied perspectives. Emphasizes both (1) physical and chemical processes in materials for the conversion of energy and (2) how to design a system with renewable energy for applications such as electricity generation and transmission. Takes a systems analysis point of view. Topics may include energy conservation; fossil fuels; and energy conversion methods for solar, geothermal, wind, hydro, bioenergy, electrochemical, and similar methods.",
