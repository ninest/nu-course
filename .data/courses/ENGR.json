    "description": "Examines, in this interdisciplinary course, modern energy usage, consequences, and options to support sustainable energy development from a variety of fundamental and applied perspectives. Emphasizes both (1) physical and chemical processes in materials for the conversion of energy and (2) how to design a system with renewable energy for applications such as electricity generation and transmission. Takes a systems analysis point of view. Topics may include energy conservation; fossil fuels; and energy conversion methods for solar, geothermal, wind, hydro, bioenergy, electrochemical, and similar methods.",

    "description": "Offers students an enhanced applied project setting in which to apply their curricular learning. Working with a partner sponsor, students refine an applied research topic, perform research, develop recommendations that are shared with the partner sponsor, and create a plan for implementing their recommendations. Curriculum supports students as they develop key business communication skills, project and client management skills, and frameworks for business analysis. Offers students an opportunity to learn from sponsor feedback, review lessons learned, and incorporate suggestions to improve and further hone their career development and professional plan. Career development opportunities through skill-building workshops, panels, and interview preparation are available. Partner-student interactions, including a culminating project presentation, allow partners to assess student potential for co-op, internship, or other employment opportunities with the partner.",
