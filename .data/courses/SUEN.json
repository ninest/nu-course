Core topics include the spatial and operational role in the built landscape of living systems&#8212;such as constructed wetlands, urban forests, urban wilds, and managed habitats&#8212;and their dynamic relationship to recreation, transit, food, housing, and industrial networks. Emphasizes the integration of constructed ecologies into the cultural landscape around issues of environmental justice. Continues the introduction of key tools and media from SUEN 6110, including advanced digital drawing, modeling, and design communication.",
