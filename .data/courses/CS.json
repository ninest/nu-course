Reviews forms of polymorphism in object-oriented languages. Contrasts the use of inheritance and composition as dual techniques for software reuse: forwarding vs. delegation and subclassing vs. subtyping. Fosters a deeper understanding of the principles of object-oriented programming and design including software components, object-oriented design patterns, and the use of graphical design notations such as UML (unified modeling language). Basic concepts in object-oriented design are illustrated with case studies in application frameworks and by writing programs in one or more object-oriented languages.",

Includes graphics management algorithms (animation, scene graph, level of detail); basic artificial intelligence algorithms (search, decision making, sensing); and related algorithmic issues (networking, threading, input processing). Explores the use of data-driven software design. Offers students an opportunity to use a rendering engine and to build and integrate several software components to create a complete game engine. Requires students to work on several individual assignments to apply the algorithms and then develop a project in a team. Offers students an opportunity to learn team/project management; work division; team communication; and the software development cycle of implementation, testing, critique, and further iteration. Students who do not meet course prerequisites may seek permission of instructor.",

    "description": "Introduces modern program design paradigms. Starts with functional program design, introducing the notion of a design recipe. The latter consists of two parts: a task organization (ranging from the description of data to the creation of a test suite) and a data-oriented approach to the organization of programs (ranging from atomic data to self-referential data definitions and functions as data). The course then progresses to object-oriented design, explaining how it generalizes and contrasts with functional design. In addition to studying program design, students also have an opportunity to practice pair-programming and public code review techniques, as found in industry today.",

A plethora of programming languages and authoring tools have been created to lower the barrier to entry and increase the expressive capability of virtual world designers, in media ranging from text to 2D graphics to 3D virtual reality, separating the complexities of the game engine from the higher-level ‚Äúscripting‚Äù of objects and behaviors. Languages like Inform and Ink help authors craft text-based interactions, while tools like PuzzleScript, Kodu, and GameMaker embed custom languages for scripting object behavior in 2D and 3D simulations. In this class, students will gain hands-on experimentation with these languages and tools through short weekly assignments, as well as read research papers that describe and evaluate their designs, which will be discussed during class meetings. In addition to learning to work with existing tools and documentation, students will learn to identify the affordances and constraints, edit and contribute to documentation, and thoughtfully critique these tools. The final project will consist of a deep dive into a tool of each students‚Äô choosing, culminating in a final presentation.",

    "description": "Deep learning (or neural networks) is popular---in fact, in my opinion---fiery. It improves and sometimes revolutionizes many fields, for example, CV, NLP, and biology, to name a few. If you work in systems (like OSes, databases, and networked systems) and are now wondering, how about systems? This is the seminar for you.\nThis seminar studies neural networks for systems (NN4Sys). NN4Sys is emerging and has potential. People have made many proposals for NN4Sys in the past five years. Some are revolutionary (my opinion), some are useful, and some are failed attempts (of course).\nIn this seminar, we will study two papers a week. One is a systems paper (could be a paper in the 1980s), and the other is a recent paper using neural networks to solve the same or a similar problem. One example pair is Masstree[1] and Learned Index[2]. We will touch at least operating systems (SOSP, OSDI), databases (SIGMOD, VLDB), and networked systems (SIGCOMM, NSDI).\nNote that this is a seminar in systems. So, it is expected that you to have solid systems background and know how to program. It is not expected for you to understand machine learning or neural networks (in fact, you will learn the basics of neural networks from this seminar). If you're interested, join us. \n[1] Mao, Yandong, Eddie Kohler, and Robert Tappan Morris. \"Cache craftiness for fast multicore key-value storage.\". EuroSys'12.\n[2] Kraska, Tim, Alex Beutel, Ed H.

When working with such massive inputs, inherent assumptions of traditional algorithms (such as the possibility of reading or storing the whole input with a single machine) no longer hold. We thus need a new paradigm for the design and analysis of algorithms. This is precisely the focus of sublinear algorithms. In this course, we will study various algorithms whose time, space, or communication are much smaller than the input size. Problems that we study will include maximum matchings, graph connectivity, minimum spanning trees, frequency estimation, independent sets, graph coloring, and clustering. We study these problems across various models of sublinear algorithms, including sublinear time algorithms, streaming algorithms, and massively parallel computation (MPC).\nTopics (tentative list):\n‚Ä¢\tBasic probabilistic tools\n‚Ä¢\tSublinear time algorithms for average degree and connected components\n‚Ä¢\tSublinear time algorithms for maximal independent set and maximum matching via randomized greedy\n‚Ä¢\tStreaming algorithms: frequency moments estimation\n‚Ä¢\tStreaming lower bounds via communication complexity\n‚Ä¢\tMassively parallel computation (MPC): introduction, space-regimes, and simple tools\n‚Ä¢\tMPC algorithms for maximum matching\n‚Ä¢\tMPC algorithms for graph connectivity and minimum spanning trees\n‚Ä¢\tAGM linear sketching\n‚Ä¢\tSublinear algorithms for graph coloring\n‚Ä¢\tSublinear algorithms for cut problems\n‚Ä¢\tSublinear algorithms for clustering problems",
