Advocates often intend to alter public policy in support of an organization or a cause.  But influencing policy requires understanding who sets policy in the first instance.  Is the issue governed by federal, state or local law?  Are key decision makers elected or appointed?  Who is it most important to persuade and what sorts of arguments are likely to convince the key audience?  This course will introduce students to the mechanisms of government that drive key policy debates across a wide range of issues, which may include health care, market regulation, environmental policy,  housing, education, the internet, privacy, and social policy.  Emphasis will be placed on tailoring arguments to different constituencies.","coreqs":[],"prereqs":[]},{"subject":"LW","number":"7329","title":"Environmental Law","scheduleType":"Lecture","credits":3,"nuPath":[],"sections":[{"term":"202310","crn":"21369"}],"description":"This course focuses on federal and state environmental laws.
