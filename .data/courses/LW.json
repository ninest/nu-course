    "description": "Explores inequality from a range of disciplinary perspectives and the difference that can make in a variety of legal, social, and economic contexts. Elaborates methodologies for mapping ways diverse legal regimes and concepts contribute to the production, recognition, reinforcement, and maintenance of hierarchies of privilege and disadvantage between individuals, groups, localities, regions, and nations. Identifies key legal drivers in the production of inequities and explores how they shift bargaining power, redistribute resources, or otherwise ameliorate inequities or their adverse consequences. Students research a circumstance of inequality and develop a legal map to engage it. With permission of instructor, students may register for an additional credit by completing a substantial paper or equivalent writing project (in addition to other course requirements) as required by the instructor.",

    "description": "What limits are there on actions aimed at influencing public officials or public opinion?  What limits should there be?  Clearly, it is unlawful to offer a bribe to a public official to produce a desirable outcome.  But what constitutes a bribe?  Can a lobbyist send a wedding gift to a favorite legislator?  Are the rules different when advocacy efforts reach beyond United States borders?  Are there limits on what an advocate can say to promote a product or service?  Where is the line between conduct that is legally permissible and conduct that is not?  To what extent are legal boundaries and ethical boundaries aligned?  This course will explore the ethical and legal issues that arise in connection with advocacy.",

    "description": "Examines law and technology as both processes and artifacts endemic to human groups, who have been toolmakers and lawmakers since human history has been recorded. Yet, in recent times, development of technological things has outpaced development in the law, bringing about what we might describe as new “design challenges” within the law. Considers several disputes around ownership and property, and safety and risk, and offers students a conceptual framework from the social study of science and technology by which to understand technology and the law. Focuses on the regulation of “digital labor” and algorithmically convened labor markets, such as Uber.",
