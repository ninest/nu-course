    "description": "Studies the role of ethics in creative practice. Offers students an opportunity to reflect on many of the concerns creative professionals face, such as how creative practitioners manifest care as a social intervention for building intimacy, healing, and hope across communities and how to develop and articulate creative goals. From the rhetoric of trust and authenticity, to honesty and generosity, ethical concepts consistently make their way into creative practice. Examines (and affords students an opportunity to hone) strategies to systematically navigate uncertainty and iteration within creative practice, culminating in a student final creative project. Readings focus on ethical paradigms that illustrate how systems of power shape the role of creative practices in society.",
