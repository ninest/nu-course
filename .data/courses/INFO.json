Services such as Web analytics and intelligent e-commerce have promoted a rapid increase in the volume of data generated, analyzed, and archived. In order to solve the problems related to big data, a newer type of database product has emerged. Covers how to apply technologies like Hadoop, Accumulo, MongoDB, and various NoSQL databases to build simple, robust, and efficient systems to manage and analyze big data. Also describes an easy approach to big data systems that can be built and run by a small team of students. Guides students through the theory of big data systems, how to implement them in practice, and how to deploy and operate them once they are built.",
