    "description": "Explores the social psychological dimensions of structured social inequality. Overviews the &amp;#8220;social psychologies&amp;#8221; embedded in the classical social theorists, then explores the literature on sociological social psychology (as opposed to its psychological cousin), identifying key theoretical frameworks and focusing on &amp;#8220;social structure and personality&amp;#8221; (or &amp;#8220;social structure and attitudes&amp;#8221;) research. Explores relevant literatures on various &amp;#8220;subjective&amp;#8221; responses to stratification including the self-concept, stratum (that is, race, class, or gender) identification and consciousness, the process of legitimation, stratification beliefs (or stratification ideology), racial attitudes, and links between these phenomena and various policy attitudes and preferences (support for affirmative action, wealth redistribution, and so on). Also explores the ways in which such responses may contribute to the maintenance and reproduction of the status quo (social reproduction), and social change.",
