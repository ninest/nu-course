A game interface is the point at which the player interacts with the game system, which pertains to visual, auditory, and haptic cues; screens and graphical user interfaces; the player character; and the game controller. Analyzes successful and unsuccessful game interfaces from historical, theoretical, and cultural perspectives. Offers students an opportunity to learn to analyze, critique, and iteratively design innovative game user interfaces; learn about and practice game usability and game feel, as well as design techniques for user interfaces and user experience; and focus on designing innovative game interfaces as they iteratively develop and test a game interface from beginning to end, resulting in a portfolio-ready game interface prototype.
