    "description": "Introduces the relatively young field of soft matter, which encompasses the physical description of various states of soft materials including liquids, colloids, polymers, foams, gels, granular materials, and a number of biological materials. Soft matter (also known as &#8220;soft condensed matter&#8221; or &#8220;complex fluids&#8221;) is less ordered than metals and oxides (hard condensed matter) and is more subject to thermal fluctuations and applied forces. Focuses on critical thinking, problem diagnosis, estimation, statistical analysis, and data-based decision making. Includes many in-class demonstrations from colloidal assembly to emulsion stability to cellular apoptosis. Highlights applications such as industrial processing, life sciences, and environmental remediation. Requires graduate study in related field or permission of instructor.",
