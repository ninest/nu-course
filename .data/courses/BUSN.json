    "description": "Examines how strategic business decisions are made and governing policies established in today's changing corporate environment. Discusses whether it is advisable for CEOs to “take a stand” on behalf of their company and their employees when fundamental shared values and a company's purpose or mission are at stake. After a grounding in business governance theory and history, students debate whether CEOs should speak openly on controversial public issues. One can make the case that a CEO taking a position on one side of a public issue is a significant strategic risk. Conversely, stakeholders are increasingly demanding that business leaders publicly take positions and change business practices to align with those values.",
