Presents key concepts, ethical debates, and iconic works that gave shape to modernism in landscape architecture and urbanism. Focusing on eighteenth-century through mid-twentieth-century projects and designers, examines contextual factors and resulting formal, spatial, organizational, and material characteristics of built works. Using case studies, challenges students to analyze the entangled histories of landscape preservation and urban segregation and to apply theories of environmental ethics and environmental justice to questions about the built environment and the relationship between natural and social systems. Offers students an opportunity to practice formulation of a critical design perspective and landscape interpretation via reading responses, project analysis, written work, podcasts, and StoryMaps.",
