    "description": "Examines via interdisciplinary lectures how image technologies and techniques of perception endemic to visual art, popular culture and digital media shape how visual culture is understood within an expanding knowledge economy. Introduces analytical skills of observation and methods of contextual analysis (materialism, semiotics, feminisms, LGBTQ studies, queer theory, theories of decolonization and disability studies), in order for students to develop compelling interpretations of visual phenomena within a shifting global context. Visual Intelligence explains how visual studies connects to the fields of law, design, publishing, curating, conservation, and other areas of knowledge production.",

Emphasizes the ways digital image technologies are socially constructed and are based on earlier paradigms of classification and differentiation. Seminar meetings demonstrate how to critically read a range of images (e.g. texts, films, videogames, memes, artworks) by paying attention to the ways meaning is often shaped by identarian formations such as race, gender, sexual orientation, class, and ability. Investigates how diverse perspectives enhance the ability to create, while introducing students to creative professionals who actively use visual intelligence in their dynamic careers.",
