Students meet regularly with a faculty member to read and discuss the faculty member&amp;#8217;s research. Research topics vary, but general themes discussed include (a) how a specific research topic emerges and evolves over time, (b) the selection and implementation of specific research methodologies, (c) the contextualization of particular research studies within broader academic and real-world conversations, and (d) how the specific research contributes to philosophical and/or practical discussions in the world in which we live. The latter may include discussing how the research findings might help answer questions and/or be used in solving problems and making decisions. May be repeated up to three times.",
