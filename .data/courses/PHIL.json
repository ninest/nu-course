This course approaches these questions about understanding the mind from the perspective of designing it. During the first part of the course, we closely examine influential frameworks for understanding and designing intelligent systems, develop a concrete sense of how these frameworks work, and critically assess their successes and shortcomings from philosophical, empirical, and design perspectives. In the second part of the course, we build on this background to explore some of the implications of emerging technologies, such as deep learning and large language models, augmented and virtual reality, brain-machine interface, memory transfer, and more.",

    "description": "Seminar topic: Metaethics. Requires prior completion of three philosophy courses or instructor&#39;s permission.\n\nCourse description: &quot;The Earth is spherical&quot; and &quot;it is wrong to kill innocent children for fun&quot; are both true sentences. Neither of these, the empirical claim nor the ethical claim are particularly controversial. However, while there is very little (reasonable) controversy about what makes the first sentence true (and how we know it is true), there is considerable controversy about both the metaphysics and epistemology of the second claim and others like it.\n\nThis seminar will provide a broad and deep overview of central answers to metaethical questions about what makes moral claims true and how we know them. The seminar will start with a quick refresher of answers to metaethical questions that are, for the most part and for good reason, not taken seriously by contemporary metaethicists, like Cultural Relativism and Divine Command Theory.&nbsp; We will then turn to what are widely-considered the live options in contemporary Western metaethics. Some of these views deny that moral claims are true or false (Non-Cognitivism), some claim that all moral claims are false (Error Theory) or that moral language is simply a fiction where we pretend some moral claims are true (Fictionalism). On most views, there are genuine truth-makers for moral claims, but there is much disagreement about what they are. On some views, they are grounded in our subjective attitudes or desires (Subjectivism), on others they are tightly bound up with rationality (constructivism), on yet others, the moral truth-makers are entirely independent of us, either very much like the natural facts that make empirical claims true (Naturalist Realism) or some more mysterious kind of non-natural fact (Non-naturalist Realism). After a critical survey of the terrain, we&#39;ll turn our attention to book-length treatments of particular views or articles that push us to think about metaethical issues in new ways.&nbsp;",

    "description": "Requires prior completion of three philosophy or religion courses or instructor&#39;s permission.\n\nDescription: We think we know cultural appropriation when we see it. Blackface, Native American headdresses, all manner of Halloween costumes&mdash;these clearly give offense. But what about Cardi B posing as the Hindu Goddess Durga in a Reebok ad, AA&rsquo;s twelve-step invocation of God, or the earnest namaste you utter at the end of yoga class?\n\nIn this class we will unpack the ethical dilemmas of a messy form of cultural appropriation: the borrowing of religious doctrines, rituals, and dress for political, educational, and therapeutic reasons. Does borrowing from another&rsquo;s religion harm believers? Who can consent to such borrowings? Religion is an especially vexing arena for appropriation debates because diversity within religious groups scrambles our sense of who is an insider and who is not. In order to understand why some appropriations are insulting and others benign, we will have to ask difficult philosophical questions about what religions really are.\n\nStudents will develop their own independent research projects and create public-facing ways to share their findings.",

In order to realize the benefits of AI while responsibly developing and implementing it, it is necessary to identify the ethical issues at stake and work to resolve them. This course takes up the philosophical and ethical questions essential to this project.",
