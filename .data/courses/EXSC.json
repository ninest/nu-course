    "description": "Offers students an opportunity to gain an understanding of physiological principles of the cardiopulmonary system. This advanced course covers (1) the structure and functional operation and regulation of the cardiopulmonary system; (2) disease-associated physiological changes and cardiopulmonary dysfunction; (3) exercise-induced acute responses and physiological adaptations of the system and their applications to chronic cardiopulmonary diseases. Encourages students to integrate their knowledge of exercise and physical activity with cardiopulmonary health and fitness, as well as cardiopulmonary disease prevention and treatment. Restricted to graduate students in exercise science and undergraduate students minoring in exercise science.",

Offers students an opportunity to learn the fundamental concepts and techniques to measure physical activity, exercise, and related testing procedures through a hands-on approach. Topics include the use of questionnaires and activity monitors to measure physical activity; measurement of body composition, fitness, muscular strength, and endurance; and clinical exercise testing. The fundamental concepts of exercise prescription and use of measurement techniques taught in this course are applicable to careers in physical therapy, exercise physiology, and as a physician assistant. Requires prior completion of EXSC 4500 or equivalent undergraduate course or permission of instructor.",
