    "description": "Designed as an integrative capstone experience for behavioral neuroscience students who are also enrolled in approved research courses where they conduct original research under the direction of an approved mentor. Students gain experience in writing a research proposal, conducting the proposed research, producing a research report, and presenting their work. Students engage in solving novel problems while reflecting on and integrating their prior learning in the discipline. Requires writing with revision and oral presentation. Offers students an opportunity to refine reflection and communication skills through formal and informal presentations, discussions, and critique.",
