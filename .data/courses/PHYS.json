It is a mosaic of different themes that offer a concise overview of science&amp;#8217;s greatest minds, ideas, questions, discoveries, theories, and methods while placing all of them within their historical contexts. Emphasizes the profound scientific revolutions of the 20th century&amp;#8212;quantum mechanics, biogenetics, and artificial intelligence&amp;#8212;that unlocked the secrets of the atom, unraveled the molecule of life, and created the electronic computer. Recognizes significant trends across a wide range of subjects, including medicine, biotechnology, computing and communicating, artificial intelligence and artificial life, and robotics.
