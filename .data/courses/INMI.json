    "description": "\"This course overviews a number of paradoxical physical events and assesses their scientific viability and limitations according to current empirical investigations. We will analyze the societal, moral, and religious implications of their use in a number of popular culture venues such as film, novels, and comics.Students will analyze scientific paradoxes such as time-travel, living in computer simulations, the puzzle of the compatibility between free-will and physical determinism, the conundrums of artificial\nintelligence (AI), and the possibility and causes of human extinction (the Doomsday argument). The course centers on both the scientific explanation of these events and the deep impact that popular and theoretical approaches had, have, and will continuously have on our current notions of rationality.\"",
