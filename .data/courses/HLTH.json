The majority of alternative and complementary medical strategies were developed in a specific historical and cultural context. Some of the therapies have had an impact on human health for thousands of years. Others have become popular only recently. Many methods discussed are fused with different cultural practices, such as the concept of “vitalism,” a force that modern science does not recognize but is an important attribute in certain cultural practices. Some methods have long and successful histories based upon sophisticated ancient medical theories, such as “Chi,” found in Chinese medicine.",
