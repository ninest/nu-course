Exposes students to key concepts, lineages, controversies, and consequences of media practices that expose injustice and seek to build a more equitable and sustainable world. Positions media arts as an intersectional and interdisciplinary practice connecting racial, gender, technological, and spatial/environmental justice. Also serves as an introduction to this dynamic and growing field of professional practice, with illustrative case studies that include interdisciplinary creative work by CAMD faculty as well as leading international practitioners.",
