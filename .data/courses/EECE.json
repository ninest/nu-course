Modeling large and complex systems requires reasoning about probabilistic behavior at a large scale. Reviews classic topics like Markov chains, convergence to a steady state, renewal processes, renewal reward processes, the strong law of large numbers, and the elementary renewal theorem. Additional topics include the asymptotic behavior of probabilistic systems, including stochastic approximation/Robbins-Monro type algorithms, and ODE/fluid limits. Illustrates how these modeling techniques can be applied in modeling real systems and adaptive algorithms, including queueing systems, distributed systems, and online learning algorithms like stochastic gradient descent.",
