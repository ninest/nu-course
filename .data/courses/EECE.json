    "description": "Develops the basic theory of continuous and discrete systems, emphasizing linear time-invariant systems. Discusses the representation of signals and systems in both the time and frequency domain. Topics include linearity, time invariance, causality, stability, convolution, system interconnection, and sinusoidal response. Develops the Fourier and Laplace transforms for the discussion of frequency-domain applications. Analyzes sampling and quantization of continuous waveforms (A/D and D/A conversion), leading to the discussion of discrete-time FIR and IIR systems, recursive analysis, and realization. The Z-transform and the discrete-time Fourier transform are developed and applied to the analysis of discrete-time signals and systems.",

Currently, both academia and industry (e.g., Apple, Qualcomm, Samsung, Huawei) unanimously agree on the critical role that the terahertz band (i.e., the frequencies between 100 GHz and 10 THz) will play in 6G. In this course, you will learn the fundamentals of terahertz communication networks for 6G, by following a holistic bottom-up approach from RF devices and wireless propagation, to ultrabroadband communications and ultradirectional networks.",
