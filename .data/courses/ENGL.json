    "description": "The idea and ideals of love and romance in contemporary American (and English) culture have been shaped by a number of literary texts from the medieval period: the story of King Arthur, Guinevere, and Lancelot is the best known. Medieval readers loved reading about unrequited love and romantic triangles&mdash;and apparently, so do we. In fact, in &ldquo;Dreaming the Middle Ages,&rdquo; Umberto Eco argues that the history of the notion of love as &ldquo;a devastating unhappy happiness&rdquo; is rooted in the Middle Ages&mdash;this notion still has traction today, as John Cusack&rsquo;s hapless character in High Fidelity (2000), Rob Gordon, demonstrates when he says:\nWhat came first? The music or the misery? People worry about kids playing with guns, or watching violent videos, that some sort of cultural violence will take them over. Nobody worries about kids listening to thousands of songs, literally thousands of songs, about heartbreak, rejection, pain, misery, and loss. Did I listen to pop music because I was miserable, or was I miserable because I listened to pop music?\nThus Rob riffs on Oscar Wilde&rsquo;s famous statement, &ldquo;Life imitates Art far more than Art imitates Life.&rdquo; We shall discuss! We&rsquo;ll read a number of medieval romances and pair them with modern written retellings and films set in the Middle Ages. We&rsquo;ll explore representations of love, romance, and sexual desire, and study how romances construct masculinity and femininity and attempt to confirm heteronormativity as the ideal&mdash;and also how romances, medieval and modern, also have the power to destabilize the binaries of masculine and feminine as well as disrupt the heteronormative.

    "description": "The pointing finger on your computer screen. The gothic spires punctuating the American skyline. The landscape of many a video game. The US Marine holding a ceremonial sword. These and other residues of the Middle Ages are baked into our everyday lives. The appropriation of the medieval is ubiquitous, and never ideologically innocent, running the gamut from Wagner&rsquo;s Ring opera to the Med-Ren Faire to Dreamworks&rsquo; Shrek to the shields that white supremacists carried in Charlottesville. In this course, our focus is on the persistence of the Middle Ages as a mode and a theme in literature, music, art, and architecture, as well as in film, video games, and other artifacts of popular culture. We will consider such topics as aesthetics, pleasure, danger, canonization, genre, colonialism, the gothic, fantasy literature, and modern responses to medieval representations of class, race, gender, and sexual preference and identity, and pair &ldquo;host&rdquo; texts and &ldquo;symbiont&rdquo; texts, such as Malory&rsquo;s Morte Darthur and a selection of Chaucer&rsquo;s Canterbury Tales and their reworkings, including film. As we read such texts as the Irish T&aacute;in B&oacute; C&uacute;ailnge, the French Tristan and Iseult and Roman de Silence (a tale of born-sex vs. cultural assignment), the Icelandic V&iacute;nland Sagas (the tale of the Norse discovery of America), and the West African Sundiata, we will explore how&mdash;and why&mdash;we read medieval texts now. We will also read a few modern texts that are medievalized in some way, but don&rsquo;t necessarily derive from any given medieval text (such as James Meek&#39;s To Calais in Ordinary Time [2019]). Students are encouraged to make connections between the medieval and their own areas of interest, and therefore will choose some of the materials for the last part of the course that should lead to final papers. All medieval texts in translation. Requirements: short responses to be read and discussed in class, a class presentation, and a final paper.",

    "description": "Topics in Literary Study - Trauma, Memory, and Contemporary Literature: This course explores how contemporary literature addresses itself to trauma, and the practice and process of memory.  How does contemporary literature express trauma, and how has it been shaped by it? Across a range of genres&mdash;and including works about racism, illness, slavery, the Holocaust, and recent wars&mdash;we will examine how literary-artistic form can express, conceptualize, and hold the knowledge of trauma, whether in novels, graphic novels, memoir, poetry, or film. We will also look closely the question of the function and role of memory in literature, thinking about collective and cultural memory, in addition to anchoring ourselves in contemporary theories of trauma and event.  Recent controversial public writing (as by Parul Sehgal on trauma and Philip Gourevitch on the value of memory) will also be considered.  Works may include novels such as Morrison&rsquo;s Beloved, Coetzee&rsquo;s Disgrace, Hemon&rsquo;s The Lazarus Project, and Saunders&rsquo;s Lincoln in the Bardo; graphic novels such as Spiegelman&rsquo;s Maus, Sacco&rsquo;s The Fixer, Mart&iacute;nez and Hall&rsquo;s Wake, and Czerwiec&rsquo;s Taking Turns; experimental poetry by Juliana Spahr and Claudia Rankine, and film such as Alain Resnais&rsquo;s Hiroshima Mon Amour.",

    "description": "Justice-Oriented Writing Assessment: Antiracist, Decolonial, and Anti-Ableist Approaches to Evaluating Writing: In the U.S., writing assessment is woven through our lives. In pre-schools, children&rsquo;s&rsquo; development is, in part, traced through their recognition of letters and their pre-literacy abilities. In the K-12 educational system, high-stakes writing assessments are mandated by federal and state governments and are one metric to track school if schools are meeting grade-level learning standards. In colleges, writing assessment is used to track students and measure the &ldquo;effectiveness&rdquo; of programs. Teachers and writing center tutors also use writing assessment methods, such as response and self-assessment, to help writers meet their goals. Within workplaces and professional programs, writing assessment is a means to determine qualifications of candidates and determine licensure. Finally, writing assessment has played a role in U.S. immigration policies and colonialism. In short, the assessment of writing is ubiquitous in U.S. culture. While there has long been attention to the injustices of testing, today there is a renewed urgency to challenging and changing unjust writing assessment practices. In this course, we will learn key theoretical ideas about evaluation and learning, explore the histories of use and misuse of writing testing in the U.S., and wrestle with emerging antiracist, decolonial, and anti-ableist approaches to writing assessment. Such justice-oriented frameworks and methods can be applied to the teaching and assessment of writing in any context. Students will be given options for different kinds of projects to fulfill the course requirements. All evaluation in this course will be shared evaluation methods.",

    "description": "In this class, we engage decolonial theory and praxis by taking as our focus rhetorics of difference. We will begin by detecting the ways in which we are constructed as discursive subjects in the colonial matrix of power. What are our privileges as these relate to modern imperial legacies of knowing and being? What are our baselines for normalcy and difference as these relate to modern imperial legacies of knowing and being?\n \nThe second part of the course asks us to name and epistemically delink from rhetorics of difference. We will learn to unlearn the ways in which we are written by imperial pasts and presents. In what ways might the consumption and production of rhetorics of difference contribute to sustaining imperial legacies of power? In what ways might we as discursive subjects embody and practice social, linguistic, racial, and epistemic differencing? What is to be done?\n \nThe third part of the course introduces decolonial methodology and methods to oppose and unsettle the creation of difference. We will imagine and propose decolonial projects of doing, making, and being as we take up the questions: How can we unsettle the production of difference in our teaching, research, and day-to-day practice of knowing and being? How might we as students, scholars, teachers, and citizens of earth engage in decoloniality and create together pluriversal possibilities?\n \nFinally, we will present the initial results of our praxis projects as we attempt to create alternatives to rhetorics of difference. What projects might we propose to recuperate suppressed epistemologies or to imagine alternatives to the hierarchical structures of everyday life or to help our students learn to unlearn? Assignments will include original scholarship and analyses, presentations, a project proposal and initial results.",
