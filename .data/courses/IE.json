The applications of systems engineering methods, such as optimization, simulation, and queuing models, are discussed through papers and case studies in different care settings (e.g., hospitals, emergency departments, surgery departments, and outpatient clinics) for different diseases (e.g. diabetes, cancer, mental health, cardiovascular disease). Uses spreadsheet tools to model and solve simulation and optimization problems. Requires equivalent course work if prerequisites are not met.",

Lean thinking is imperative for organizations aspiring to stay competitive in global markets. It calls for process changes to eliminate waste, shorten product delivery time, improve product quality, and curtail costs, while improving customer satisfaction. Offers students an opportunity to learn concepts, a kit of process improvement tools, implementation methods, and best practices for lean workforce development. Makes extensive use of active learning exercises and simulations, and case studies from different disciplines, to help students learn how lean principles are applied in manufacturing and also in less traditional areas such as knowledge work and healthcare systems.",
