There is an unprecedented need for flexible and responsive practices that can bridge the gap between traditional professional techniques and these situations. Requires core competencies that are not mismatched with the changing situations of practice. Requires new skills as well as traditional analytic techniques to respond adequately to these unique conditions of work.

Interpreting complex and partial information is a routine task in research as well as in our daily lives. Such tasks include estimating quantitative properties of a biological system from indirect noisy measurements, responding to fluctuating environmental signals, or breaking encrypted messages. Common to these diverse questions is a need to construct a predictive model from partial data. Draws on examples from primary literature in biology to study text recognition, trait mapping, sequence alignment, decoding cryptographs, processing of chemoattractive signals to find food, and survival strategies of bacteria in unpredictable environments.",

    "description": "Combines molecular biology, cell biology, pharmacology, and genetics to address the fundamental molecular properties of neurons and neuronal networks. At its core, the principles that govern the communication between cells of the nervous system are determined by their molecular components. The molecular landscape defines the individual properties of a neuron and the function of neuronal networks as a whole. Focuses on neuronal signaling through the function of ion channels and receptors, supramolecular mechanisms like synaptic transmission and axonal transport, and the molecular mechanisms that underlie biological networks and neural coding of information. Uses the fundamental understanding of molecular networks as a framework to explore the mechanisms that underlie neurological diseases and disorders. Discusses current treatments and therapies that rely on modulating neuronal signaling through molecular interactions.",

Provides a historical overview of the main barriers between tumors and antitumor killer cells. The unifying focus of the lectures is the role of immunological and physiological negative regulators, i.e., “brakes” of anti-tumor immune response. A significant part of the course is dedicated to the retrospective evaluation of the last three decades of the immunological and biochemical studies that culminated in identification of the “chief of tumor defense operations,” i.e., a hypoxia-adenosinergic pathway in the tumor microenvironment.",

Fosters a deeper understanding of the principles of object-oriented programming and design including software components, object-oriented design patterns, and the use of graphical design notations such as UML (unified modeling language). Basic concepts in object-oriented design are illustrated with case studies in application frameworks and by writing programs in one or more object-oriented languages.",

    "description": "Introduces systematic problem solving through programming. Offers students an opportunity to learn how to analyze a problem, how to divide and organize the problem into appropriate components, how to describe the problem in a computer language, how to analyze and understand the behavior of their programs, and how to test that their programs are working correctly. Additionally, introduces a method of program design called object-oriented programming and various ways to organize data, including a discussion of their advantages and disadvantages. To practice the course concepts, students undertake assignments ranging from small, highly specified programming tasks to larger open-ended problems where students design and code their own solutions.",

Reviews forms of polymorphism in object-oriented languages. Contrasts the use of inheritance and composition as dual techniques for software reuse—forwarding vs. delegation and subclassing vs. subtyping. Offers students an opportunity to obtain a deeper understanding of the principles of object-oriented programming and design, including software components, object-oriented design patterns, and the use of graphical design notations such as UML (unified modeling language). Illustrates basic concepts in object-oriented design with case studies in application frameworks and by writing programs in Java.",

    "description": "Introduces modern program design paradigms. Starts with functional program design, introducing the notion of a design recipe. The latter consists of two parts: a task organization (ranging from the description of data to the creation of a test suite) and a data-oriented approach to the organization of programs (ranging from atomic data to self-referential data definitions and functions as data). The course then progresses to object-oriented design, explaining how it generalizes and contrasts with functional design. In addition to studying program design, students also have an opportunity to practice pair-programming and public code review techniques, as found in industry today.",

    "description": "Description: Designing interactive, virtual worlds (such as video game environments and virtual meeting spaces) is a multidisciplinary endeavor requiring an understanding of interaction design, user experience, and programming. A plethora of programming languages and authoring tools have been created to lower the barrier to entry and increase the expressive capability of virtual world designers, in media ranging from text to 2D graphics to 3D virtual reality, separating the complexities of the game engine from the higher-level “scripting” of objects and behaviors. Languages like Inform and Ink help authors craft text-based interactions, while tools like PuzzleScript, Kodu, and GameMaker embed custom languages for scripting object behavior in 2D and 3D simulations. In this class, students will gain hands-on experimentation with these languages and tools through short weekly assignments, as well as read research papers that describe and evaluate their designs, which will be discussed during class meetings. In addition to learning to work with existing tools and documentation, students will learn to identify the affordances and constraints, edit and contribute to documentation, and thoughtfully critique these tools. The final project will consist of a deep dive into a tool of each students’ choosing, culminating in a final presentation.",

    "description": "Deep learning (or neural networks) is popular---in fact, in my opinion---fiery. It improves and sometimes revolutionizes many fields, for example, CV, NLP, and biology, to name a few. If you work in systems (like OSes, databases, and networked systems) and are now wondering, how about systems? This is the seminar for you.\nThis seminar studies neural networks for systems (NN4Sys). NN4Sys is emerging and has potential. People have made many proposals for NN4Sys in the past five years. Some are revolutionary (my opinion), some are useful, and some are failed attempts (of course).\nIn this seminar, we will study two papers a week. One is a systems paper (could be a paper in the 1980s), and the other is a recent paper using neural networks to solve the same or a similar problem. One example pair is Masstree[1] and Learned Index[2]. We will touch at least operating systems (SOSP, OSDI), databases (SIGMOD, VLDB), and networked systems (SIGCOMM, NSDI).\nNote that this is a seminar in systems. So, it is expected that you to have solid systems background and know how to program. It is not expected for you to understand machine learning or neural networks (in fact, you will learn the basics of neural networks from this seminar). If you're interested, join us. \n[1] Mao, Yandong, Eddie Kohler, and Robert Tappan Morris. \"Cache craftiness for fast multicore key-value storage.\". EuroSys'12.\n[2] Kraska, Tim, Alex Beutel, Ed H.

Focuses on science and policy of environment management through the lens of coupled SES. Historically, the majority of studies focused on human-environment interactions have typically involved measuring and describing the negative impacts of human populations and development on natural ecosystems. More recently, however, environmental science and practice have experienced a paradigm shift to where now humans and the natural environment are recognized as tightly coupled systems. From an SES perspective, humans continue to shape the structure and function of ecosystems through both stressors and stewardship. However, a key advancement is the recognition that people and their behavior are directly influenced by structure, function, and services of ecosystems.",

Quantitative genetics, population genetics, and phylogenetics have been historically separate fields and have only recently been synthesized through genomics. Note that quantitative genetics is a field that studies the evolution of phenotypes and requires no genetic information. The second half of the course introduces major concepts in ecology and is designed to introduce students to the major historical underpinnings of community ecology so as to understand the utility (or lack thereof) of these concepts for modern ecology.",

    "description": "Designed to introduce graduate engineering students to the cooperative education program and to maximize their learning by helping them become more intentional about learning in co-op and in the transfer of that knowledge and experience to and from their academic program and throughout their entire careers. Offers students an opportunity to develop career goals; to be able to identify and justify what they need to learn through their co-op experience and entire careers; and to acquire the tools to be able to continually assess what they already know, what they think they know, what they need to know, and what they would like to know in relation to achieving their career goals. Includes readings, exercises, and discussions. This course does not count toward degree requirements.",

    "description": "The idea and ideals of love and romance in contemporary American (and English) culture have been shaped by a number of literary texts from the medieval period: the story of King Arthur, Guinevere, and Lancelot is the best known. Medieval readers loved reading about unrequited love and romantic triangles—and apparently, so do we. In fact, in “Dreaming the Middle Ages,” Umberto Eco argues that the history of the notion of love as “a devastating unhappy happiness” is rooted in the Middle Ages—this notion still has traction today, as John Cusack’s hapless character in High Fidelity (2000), Rob Gordon, demonstrates when he says:\nWhat came first? The music or the misery? People worry about kids playing with guns, or watching violent videos, that some sort of cultural violence will take them over. Nobody worries about kids listening to thousands of songs, literally thousands of songs, about heartbreak, rejection, pain, misery, and loss. Did I listen to pop music because I was miserable, or was I miserable because I listened to pop music?\nThus Rob riffs on Oscar Wilde’s famous statement, “Life imitates Art far more than Art imitates Life.” We shall discuss! We’ll read a number of medieval romances and pair them with modern written retellings and films set in the Middle Ages. We’ll explore representations of love, romance, and sexual desire, and study how romances construct masculinity and femininity and attempt to confirm heteronormativity as the ideal—and also how romances, medieval and modern, also have the power to destabilize the binaries of masculine and feminine as well as disrupt the heteronormative. Requirements: a Reading Journal and two papers, one due at midpoint and one at the end of class.",

Students will explore critical and philosophical interrogations of these themes and will also do creative writing assignments in which they try out these exciting genres. By exploring the funny and the frightening students will discover how the normative aspects of social discourse are both framed and challenged.

    "description": "The pointing finger on your computer screen. The gothic spires punctuating the American skyline. The landscape of many a video game. The US Marine holding a ceremonial sword. These and other residues of the Middle Ages are baked into our everyday lives. The appropriation of the medieval is ubiquitous, and never ideologically innocent, running the gamut from Wagner’s Ring opera to the Med-Ren Faire to Dreamworks’ Shrek to the shields that white supremacists carried in Charlottesville. In this course, our focus is on the persistence of the Middle Ages as a mode and a theme in literature, music, art, and architecture, as well as in film, video games, and other artifacts of popular culture. We will consider such topics as aesthetics, pleasure, danger, canonization, genre, colonialism, the gothic, fantasy literature, and modern responses to medieval representations of class, race, gender, and sexual preference and identity, and pair “host” texts and “symbiont” texts, such as Malory’s Morte Darthur and a selection of Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales and their reworkings, including film. As we read such texts as the Irish Táin Bó Cúailnge, the French Tristan and Iseult and Roman de Silence (a tale of born-sex vs. cultural assignment), the Icelandic Vínland Sagas (the tale of the Norse discovery of America), and the West African Sundiata, we will explore how—and why—we read medieval texts now. We will also read a few modern texts that are medievalized in some way, but don’t necessarily derive from any given medieval text (such as James Meek's To Calais in Ordinary Time [2019]). Students are encouraged to make connections between the medieval and their own areas of interest, and therefore will choose some of the materials for the last part of the course that should lead to final papers. All medieval texts in translation. Requirements: short responses to be read and discussed in class, a class presentation, and a final paper.",

How does contemporary literature express trauma, and how has it been shaped by it? Across a range of genres—and including works about racism, illness, slavery, the Holocaust, and recent wars—we will examine how literary-artistic form can express, conceptualize, and hold the knowledge of trauma, whether in novels, graphic novels, memoir, poetry, or film. We will also look closely the question of the function and role of memory in literature, thinking about collective and cultural memory, in addition to anchoring ourselves in contemporary theories of trauma and event.  Recent controversial public writing (as by Parul Sehgal on trauma and Philip Gourevitch on the value of memory) will also be considered.  Works may include novels such as Morrison’s Beloved, Coetzee’s Disgrace, Hemon’s The Lazarus Project, and Saunders’s Lincoln in the Bardo; graphic novels such as Spiegelman’s Maus, Sacco’s The Fixer, Martínez and Hall’s Wake, and Czerwiec’s Taking Turns; experimental poetry by Juliana Spahr and Claudia Rankine, and film such as Alain Resnais’s Hiroshima Mon Amour.",

    "description": "Justice-Oriented Writing Assessment: Antiracist, Decolonial, and Anti-Ableist Approaches to Evaluating Writing: In the U.S., writing assessment is woven through our lives. In pre-schools, children’s’ development is, in part, traced through their recognition of letters and their pre-literacy abilities. In the K-12 educational system, high-stakes writing assessments are mandated by federal and state governments and are one metric to track school if schools are meeting grade-level learning standards. In colleges, writing assessment is used to track students and measure the “effectiveness” of programs. Teachers and writing center tutors also use writing assessment methods, such as response and self-assessment, to help writers meet their goals. Within workplaces and professional programs, writing assessment is a means to determine qualifications of candidates and determine licensure. Finally, writing assessment has played a role in U.S. immigration policies and colonialism. In short, the assessment of writing is ubiquitous in U.S. culture. While there has long been attention to the injustices of testing, today there is a renewed urgency to challenging and changing unjust writing assessment practices. In this course, we will learn key theoretical ideas about evaluation and learning, explore the histories of use and misuse of writing testing in the U.S., and wrestle with emerging antiracist, decolonial, and anti-ableist approaches to writing assessment. Such justice-oriented frameworks and methods can be applied to the teaching and assessment of writing in any context. Students will be given options for different kinds of projects to fulfill the course requirements. All evaluation in this course will be shared evaluation methods.",

What are our privileges as these relate to modern imperial legacies of knowing and being? What are our baselines for normalcy and difference as these relate to modern imperial legacies of knowing and being?\n \nThe second part of the course asks us to name and epistemically delink from rhetorics of difference. We will learn to unlearn the ways in which we are written by imperial pasts and presents. In what ways might the consumption and production of rhetorics of difference contribute to sustaining imperial legacies of power? In what ways might we as discursive subjects embody and practice social, linguistic, racial, and epistemic differencing? What is to be done?\n \nThe third part of the course introduces decolonial methodology and methods to oppose and unsettle the creation of difference. We will imagine and propose decolonial projects of doing, making, and being as we take up the questions: How can we unsettle the production of difference in our teaching, research, and day-to-day practice of knowing and being? How might we as students, scholars, teachers, and citizens of earth engage in decoloniality and create together pluriversal possibilities?\n \nFinally, we will present the initial results of our praxis projects as we attempt to create alternatives to rhetorics of difference. What projects might we propose to recuperate suppressed epistemologies or to imagine alternatives to the hierarchical structures of everyday life or to help our students learn to unlearn?

    "description": "Designed for students whose first or strongest language is not English. Parallels ENGW 1111 but focuses on the concerns of multilingual writers. Students study and practice writing in a workshop setting; read a range of texts in order to describe and evaluate the choices writers make and apply that knowledge to their own writing; explore how writing functions in a variety of academic, professional, and public contexts; and write for various purposes and audiences in multiple genres and media. Offers students an opportunity to learn how to conduct research using primary and secondary sources and to give and receive feedback, to revise their work, and to reflect on their growth as writers.",

They will develop writing skills with real-world application in academic and professional settings. Students will arrange a community-course partnership and explore the ethical, theoretical, and strategic considerations in developing equitable partnerships. Communication and collaboration with community partners are central, and students will develop a deeper understanding of social justice issues in Boston, a toolkit for advocating for social change through writing, and experience with the logistics and ethics of creating community-campus partnerships. Students will be practicing meaningful, real-stakes writing. This course meets the same learning goals and University requirements as ENGW 1111.",

The majority of alternative and complementary medical strategies were developed in a specific historical and cultural context. Some of the therapies have had an impact on human health for thousands of years. Others have become popular only recently. Many methods discussed are fused with different cultural practices, such as the concept of “vitalism,” a force that modern science does not recognize but is an important attribute in certain cultural practices. Some methods have long and successful histories based upon sophisticated ancient medical theories, such as “Chi,” found in Chinese medicine.",

    "description": "Introduces the methods and practice of history in a digital age. Offers students an opportunity to see the wide variety of work being done computationally by historians and other humanists today and to obtain the background to be creative producers of new work and critical consumers of existing projects. The rise of computing technology and the Internet has the potential to reshape all parts of historical practice, from curation to research to dissemination. Examines the historian's craft in three primary domains: the creation of digital sources, the algorithmic transformations that computers can enact on cultural materials like texts, and the new ecologies of publishing and scholarly communication made possible by new media.",

The digital world can enhance our ability to acquire knowledge by providing us with fast and cheap access to huge amounts of information. However, it can also undermine our cognitive abilities and provide us with inaccurate or misleading information.

The interpolation is still parametric, but the parameters are graph related and do not involve analytic functions. Discusses how to explain neural models and not fear them; when it is appropriate to use neural models; and how to interact with machines that use neural models in the same way one would trust a friend, so that trust between humans and machines is enhanced rather than diminished. These so-called neural models mirror in some regard how biological brains build models to make sense of the world and do predictions.",

This course focuses on three domains of the broader subject: the evolution and current state of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; the architecture of the drug regulation system in the U.S., including the distinct space occupied by the Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Agriculture, and the Drug Enforcement Agency; and the role of regulation and tort litigation in harmonizing drug policy with science. Designed around legal and policy case studies, this course is intended for students expecting to become involved in clinical practice involving pharmaceuticals as well those generally interested in the interplay of law and public health.",

Given that biological evidence suitable for post-conviction DNA testing is available in only a smattering of cases, the exonerations generated by DNA represent only the tip of the innocence iceberg, so to speak. This class will explore (1) the primary factors that contribute to the phenomenon of wrongful convictions, (2) the state and federal procedures through which post-conviction claims are litigated and (3) potential reforms to protect against the conviction of the innocent.",

Derivatives are used to model rates of change, to estimate change, to optimize functions, and in marginal analysis. The integral calculus is applied to accumulation functions and future value. Emphasis is on realistic business and economics problems, the development of mathematical models from raw business data, and the translation of mathematical results into verbal expression appropriate for the business setting. Also features a semester-long marketing project in which students gather raw data, model it, and use calculus to make business decisions; each student is responsible for a ten-minute presentation.

Requires prior completion of three philosophy courses or instructor's permission.\n\nCourse description: \"The Earth is spherical\" and \"it is wrong to kill innocent children for fun\" are both true sentences. Neither of these, the empirical claim nor the ethical claim are particularly controversial. However, while there is very little (reasonable) controversy about what makes the first sentence true (and how we know it is true), there is considerable controversy about both the metaphysics and epistemology of the second claim and others like it.\n\nThis seminar will provide a broad and deep overview of central answers to metaethical questions about what makes moral claims true and how we know them. The seminar will start with a quick refresher of answers to metaethical questions that are, for the most part and for good reason, not taken seriously by contemporary metaethicists, like Cultural Relativism and Divine Command Theory.  We will then turn to what are widely-considered the live options in contemporary Western metaethics. Some of these views deny that moral claims are true or false (Non-Cognitivism), some claim that all moral claims are false (Error Theory) or that moral language is simply a fiction where we pretend some moral claims are true (Fictionalism). On most views, there are genuine truth-makers for moral claims, but there is much disagreement about what they are. On some views, they are grounded in our subjective attitudes or desires (Subjectivism), on others they are tightly bound up with rationality (constructivism), on yet others, the moral truth-makers are entirely independent of us, either very much like the natural facts that make empirical claims true (Naturalist Realism) or some more mysterious kind of non-natural fact (Non-naturalist Realism). After a critical survey of the terrain, we'll turn our attention to book-length treatments of particular views or articles that push us to think about metaethical issues in new ways. ",

Blackface, Native American headdresses, all manner of Halloween costumes—these clearly give offense. But what about Cardi B posing as the Hindu Goddess Durga in a Reebok ad, AA’s twelve-step invocation of God, or the earnest namaste you utter at the end of yoga class?\n\nIn this class we will unpack the ethical dilemmas of a messy form of cultural appropriation: the borrowing of religious doctrines, rituals, and dress for political, educational, and therapeutic reasons. Does borrowing from another’s religion harm believers? Who can consent to such borrowings? Religion is an especially vexing arena for appropriation debates because diversity within religious groups scrambles our sense of who is an insider and who is not. In order to understand why some appropriations are insulting and others benign, we will have to ask difficult philosophical questions about what religions really are.\n\nStudents will develop their own independent research projects and create public-facing ways to share their findings.",

Dynamical processes in complex networks provide a rationale for understanding the emerging tipping points and nonlinear properties that often underpin the most interesting characteristics of sociotechnical systems. Reviews the recent progress in modeling dynamical processes that integrates the complex features and heterogeneities of real-world systems.",

Using a comparative case study approach, explores the importance of the local context; the intersections of politics, economics, and culture; ecology and human-environment relationships; and the role (and challenges) of finance and development assistance. Climate impacts threaten to reverse many of the development gains of the last century, and the most vulnerable are likely to be the most impacted by climate change. At the same time, opportunities exist to ensure climate-compatible development pathways. Cross-listed with INTL 5100.",

    "description": "Reviews the dominant theoretical traditions in contemporary sociology, examining the key assumptions, terminology, weaknesses, and strengths of the pluralist, managerialist, neo-Marxist, feminist, and postmodern paradigms. Strives not only to expose students to the giants in the field but, more important, to give students the intellectual tools to situate entire theoretical traditions vis-à-vis one another. Introduces students to various schools of thought. Offers students the opportunity to learn “how to think” sociologically and theoretically—that is, to go beyond simplistic and descriptive accounts of social phenomena to offer more systematic and insightful explanations.",

Overviews the “social psychologies” embedded in the classical social theorists, then explores the literature on sociological social psychology (as opposed to its psychological cousin), identifying key theoretical frameworks and focusing on “social structure and personality” (or “social structure and attitudes”) research. Explores relevant literatures on various “subjective” responses to stratification including the self-concept, stratum (that is, race, class, or gender) identification and consciousness, the process of legitimation, stratification beliefs (or stratification ideology), racial attitudes, and links between these phenomena and various policy attitudes and preferences (support for affirmative action, wealth redistribution, and so on).

This interdisciplinary course offers debates around sex, gender, sexuality, and the body that push beyond binary models reliant on a simple “nature/culture” distinction. Focuses on dynamic and variable aspects of sexuality, sex, and gender within and across cultures, representational forms, and historical periods, analyzing the circumstances in which they undergo significant challenge or transformation. Uses particular paradigmatic “case studies” to push hard at the boundaries of sex and gender and to dialogue around contesting conceptualizations of “the body,” “sex,” and “gender,” particularly as they circulate in specific discourses of feminism, queer theory, and poststructuralism; ethnic studies; critical race theory; and cultural studies.",
